          Mozilla Firefox is a fast browser that is known for privacy unlike it's competitor, Google Chrome.
          Firefox was created in 2002, and was known as Phoenix at the time.

          One of Firefox's specialties is the private browsing experience that it offers to its users. Compared to Chrome, this is a welcomed change as some users do not want a browser to be selling
          information about themselves.
