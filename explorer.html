Internet Explorer (now known as Edge) is a browser that ships with Microsoft computers. Previously a very popular browser, it is now one of the least used due to it being outdated and buggy.
Created in 1995 as an alternative to Netscape. </p>

Explorer has long been known as a buggy, outdated browser. The only reason a user would really require Explorer is to use dated technologies on websites, such as Active X.
        Older browsers are usually not designed for the interactive web that we have today.</p>
